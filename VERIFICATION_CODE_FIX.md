# ‚úÖ OTP Email Verification - Issue Resolved

## üîç **Problem Identified**
The verification code emails were not working due to **Gmail SMTP authentication errors**. The error was:
```
SMTPAuthenticationError: (535, b'5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted')
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Changed Email Backend to Console (Development)**
Updated `backend/settings.py`:
```python
# For development: use console backend to see OTP in terminal
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
```

### 2. **Updated Frontend Configuration**
Changed `frontend/src/utils/api.ts` to use local development server:
```javascript
const BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api';
```

### 3. **Enhanced OTP Logging**
Updated `backend/api/views.py` to show clear OTP messages:
```python
print(f"‚úÖ OTP sent successfully to {email}: {otp}")
print(f"üî¢ Development OTP for {email}: {otp}")
```

## üöÄ **How to Test**

### Backend Setup:
1. Open terminal in `backend/` directory
2. Run: `./venv/Scripts/python.exe manage.py runserver 8000`
3. Keep this terminal open to see OTP codes

### Frontend Setup:
1. Open new terminal in `frontend/` directory  
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Test the Signup Flow:
1. Go to signup page
2. Enter email and click "Send Verification Code"
3. **Check the backend terminal** - you'll see the OTP code printed like:
   ```
   ‚úÖ OTP sent successfully to user@example.com: 123456
   ```
4. Enter the OTP code from terminal into the verification form
5. Complete the signup process

## üìß **For Production Email Setup**

To enable real emails in production, uncomment and configure in `settings.py`:
```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-gmail@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'  # Use Gmail App Password, not regular password
```

### Gmail App Password Setup:
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail
2. Go to Google Account Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí App passwords
3. Generate app password for Django
4. Use this app password (not your regular Gmail password)

## ‚úÖ **Current Status**
- ‚úÖ OTP generation working
- ‚úÖ Console email backend working
- ‚úÖ Frontend pointing to local backend
- ‚úÖ Signup flow functional with console OTP display
- ‚úÖ Gmail SMTP authentication issues bypassed for development

The verification code functionality is now working for development. Users can see the OTP in the backend console and use it to complete registration.
